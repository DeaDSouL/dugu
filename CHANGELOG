TODO in future:
    * Let the app in scanning process decide when to or not to use the Multiprocessing module.
      (e.g: if 80% of file's sizes are bigger than 2.6MiB, then use Multiprocessing module)
    * export results to JSON.
    * See if we'll gain anything by adding a counter for the total instance in DuGuFileInfo().
        --> didn't work since they live in sub-processes and die when sub-processes die.
    * instead of printing results in DuGuScan(), yield what to print?

DuGu v1.0.0:
    Changes:
        * Rewrote the code from scratch with OOP concept in mind.
        * Used pure Python3 code, and dropped python2 support.
        * Implemented Multiprocessing and Threading modules only when they're affective.
        * DuGu is now 4.134 times faster than how it used to be, when dealing with too many large files.
        * Check the free available disk space before proceeding with the (precopy or isolation) process.
        * Splitting the old huge one 'dugu.py' file into multiple smaller specialized objects.
        * The result of (scan process, and found duplicates) are being stored in objects instead of dictionary
          variables.
        * Caching objects instead of a dictionary variables.
    New features:
        * -S, --follow-symlinks: which if used, will follow all symlinked directories even if they were out of scanned
          directory.
        * -l, --soft-links: which generates soft links of the duplicates. formerly known as (--links).
        * -L, --hard-links: which generates hard links of the duplicates.
    Fixes:
        * #2:   precopy takes long time if DIR1 is huge:
                Now it copies only the unique files in 'precopy', instead of how it used to be in v0.1.
        * #4:   Incorrect files counting while validating cache:
                All paths given by user, are being converted to the absolute paths to avoid similar issues.
